# PasswordGen
Password Generator HW02

I restarted about 3 times, you will probably see there. At first I was only able to find tutorials online to create password gen with checkboxes even of prompts.
Then I was struggling to understand how it working the way it did.

Second attempt, I revereted back to using prompts and confirms and kept the functions to generate random letters and symbols.
Got stuck with if then statments. 

Third attempt, I reached out for TA's help. He reviewed my code and told me I could eliminate the each function that generate random lowercase/uppercaseletters and symbols. Then turn them into variables, put those variables into the if then statments to concatenate if the userInput = true.
